Snowtrack is a fantastic tool for file and project versioning. This chapter is dedicated to creators of 2D/3D graphic tutorials to help them bring their tutorials to the next level.

A lot of creators share the final project file of a tutorial with their audience. Users love to download these as they can immediately start exploring.

![left](/img/versions-few.png) With Snowtrack you can now go a step further and share all versions of your tutorial. This way your audience can inspect the stages and files they are interested in.

## How do I start?

The chapter [Getting started](get-started.md) guides you through the basics of Snowtrack.

## How do I export?

Since version `0.8.75` you can export versions to a `*.snowproj` file and share it. Click on the export icon in the bar above the left project timeline. A dropdown menu will offer you the option to export all tracks, or just an individual one.

**Quick Tip:** Before you export your project, verify the versions you have created throughout your tutorial. If there is a version you don't want to share, you can easily remove it. Check out this [chapter](versions.md#how-to-delete-a-version) for more information.

## What is a `*.snowproj` file?

![Snow Project](/img/snowproj-file.jpg)

A `*.snowproj` file contains all file versions of your project. The file can be shared with your audience. A double-click or drag-and-drop will unpack and open the project. The user can eventually inspect and restore individual versions.

## Who can open `*.snowproj` files?

The current beta version of Snowtrack is available for free. After the beta phase is over, Snowtrack will be available as a **free** and paid version. For you, as a tutorial creator, it is important that your tutorials and projects are accessible to your entire userbase. **That's why Snowtrack's free version will be able to open `*.snowproj` files.**

<div className="info" ></div>

`*.snowproj` files are technically a zip file and can be unpacked with any regular unzipper. You can manually restore the files, or use our free open-source project [SnowFS](https://www.github.com/snowtrack/snowfs) to inspect the project.

## Example

After you have [installed](https://www.snowtrack.io/download-beta) Snowtrack, download the example project below to experience firsthand how a versioned project can look like.
