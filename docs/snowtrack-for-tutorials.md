Snowtrack is a fantastic tool for file and project versioning. This chapter is dedicated to creators of 2D/3D graphic tutorials to help them bring their tutorials to the next level. A lot of creators share the final project file of a tutorial with their audience. Users love to download these as they can immediately start exploring.

With Snowtrack you can now go a step further and share all versions of your tutorial. This way your audience can inspect and open every single file of the project as it evolved.

## How do I start?

<div className="info" ></div>

If you plan to use Snowtrack during a video tutorial, you don't need to switch back and forth between Snowtrack and your graphic application to create a new version. You can create new versions within **Photoshop**, **Blender**, **Cinema 4D**, **Pixelmator**, **Affinity Photo**, .. and many more by using a system-wide shortcut. Check out this [chapter](versions.md#system-wide-shortcuts) for more information.

## How do I export?

Since version `0.8.75` you can export versions to a `*.snowproj` file and share it. Click on the export icon in the bar above the left project timeline. A dropdown menu will offer you the option to export all tracks, or just an individual one.

**Quick Tip:** Before you export your project, verify the versions you have created throughout your tutorial. If there is a version you don't want to share, you can easily remove it. Check out this [chapter](versions.md#how-to-delete-a-version) for more information.

## What is a `*.snowproj` file?

![Snow Project](/img/snowproj-file.jpg)

A `*.snowproj` file contains all file versions of your project. The file can be shared with your audience. A double-click or drag-and-drop will unpack and open the project. The user can eventually inspect and restore individual versions.

## Who can open `*.snowproj` files?

The current beta version of Snowtrack is available for free. After the beta phase is over, Snowtrack will be available as a **free** and paid version. For you, as a tutorial creator, it is important that your tutorials and projects are accessible to your entire userbase. **That's why Snowtrack's free version will be able to open `*.snowproj` files.**

<div className="info" ></div>

`*.snowproj` files are technically a zip file and can be unpacked with any regular unzipper. You can manually restore the files, or use our free and open-source project [SnowFS](https://www.github.com/snowtrack/snowfs) to inspect the project.
