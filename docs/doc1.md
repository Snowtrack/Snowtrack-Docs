Snowtrack is an easy-to-use version control software for graphic projects built to help you manage your file and project versions. Snowtrack supports all file types and has extensive [support](file-support.md) for a variety of 2D and 3D file formats.

Snowtrack integrates effortlessly into your existing workflows. You can open, browse, and inspect your projects in one well-designed interface.

Getting started with Snowtrack is similar to working with your favorite 2D or 3D application. Simply create a project in Snowtrack and place your files into the newly-created directory.

Already started a project? No problem, simply drag and drop your existing folder into the Snowtrack application. With a simple click you can start tracking your existing projects.
